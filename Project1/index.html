        <h2 class="center spacing">Here's a time-line of steve Jobs's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="spacing">
            <strong>1995</strong> - Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in
            San Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.
            He grew up with one sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and
            fixed cars as a hobby.
          </li>
          <li class="spacing">
            <strong>1972</strong> - After graduating from high school in 1972,
            Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, for two years. He
            dropped out after one semester to visit India and study eastern
            religions in the summer of 1974.
          </li>
          <li class="spacing">
            <strong>1975</strong> - In 1975 Jobs joined a group known as the
            Homebrew Computer Club. One member, a technical whiz named Steve
            Wozniak, was trying to build a computer. Jobs and Wozniak attended
            meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping
            stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer.
          </li>

          <li class="spacing">
            <strong>1976</strong> - In 1976 he and Wozniak formed their own
            company. They called it Apple Computer Company, in memory of a happy
            summer Jobs had spent picking apples. They raised $1,300 in startup
            money by selling Jobs's microbus and Wozniak's calculator. At first
            they sold circuit boards (the boards that hold the internal
            components of a computer) while they worked on the computer
            prototype (sample).
          </li>

          <li class="spacing">
            <stron>1984</stron> - In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new
            model, the Macintosh. The on-screen display had small pictures
            called icons. To use the computer, the user pointed at an icon and
            clicked a button using a new device called a mouse. This process
            made the Macintosh very easy to use. The Macintosh did not sell well
            to businesses, however. It lacked features other personal computers
            had, such as a corresponding high quality printer.
          </li>

          <li class="spacing">
            <strong>1985</strong> - The failure of the Macintosh signaled the
            beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Jobs resigned in 1985 from
            the company he had helped found, though he retained his title as
            chairman of its board of directors.
          </li>

          <li class="spacing">
            <strong>1996</strong> In a February 1996 Time magazine article, Jobs
            said, "The thing that drives me and my colleagues … is that you see
            something very compelling to you, and you don't quite know how to
            get it, but you know, sometimes intuitively, it's within your grasp.
            And it's worth putting in years of your life to make it come into
            existence." Jobs has worked hard to translate his ideas into
            exciting and innovative products for businesses and consumers. He
            was instrumental in launching the age of the personal computer.
            Steve Jobs is truly a computer industry visionary. In December of
            1996 Apple purchased NeXT Software for over $400 million. Jobs
            returned to Apple as a part-time consultant to the chief executive
            officer (CEO). The following year, in a surprising event, Apple
            entered into a partnership with its competitor Microsoft. The two
            companies, according to the New York Times, "agreed to cooperate on
            several sales and technology fronts." Over the next six years Apple
            introduced several new products and marketing strategies.
          </li>

          <li class="spacing">
            <strong>1997</strong> - In November 1997 Jobs announced Apple would
            sell computers directly to users over the Internet and by telephone.
            The Apple Store became a runaway success. Within a week it was the
            third-largest e-commerce site on the Internet. In September of 1997
            Jobs was named interim CEO of Apple. In 1998 Jobs announced the
            release of the iMac, which featured powerful computing at an
            affordable price. The iBook was unveiled in July 1999. This is a
            clam-shaped laptop that is available in bright colors. It includes
            Apple's AirPort, a computer version of the cordless phone that would
            allow the user to surf the Internet wirelessly. In January 2000 Jobs
            unveiled Apple's new Internet strategy. It included a group of
            Macintosh-only Internet-based applications. Jobs also announced that
            he was becoming the permanent CEO of Apple.

          <li class="spacing">
            <strong>2011</strong> - Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home
            around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a
            relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic
            neuroendocrine tumor,which resulted in respiratory arrest. He had
            lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children,
            and sisters at his side. His sister, Mona Simpson, described his
            death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables,
            repeated three times. Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister
            Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's
            partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's
            final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost
            consciousness and died several hours later. A small private funeral
            was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect
            for Jobs's family, were not made public.

              >I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and
              idealistic industry. There weren't many degrees offered in
              computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people
              from mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved
              it, and no one was really in it for the money... There are people
              around here who start companies just to make money, but the great
              companies, well, that's not what they're about." —Steve Jobs
